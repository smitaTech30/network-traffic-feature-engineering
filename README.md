# Network Traffic Feature Engineering

This project implements a clean and reproducible pipeline for extracting packet-level and flow-level features from network traffic PCAP files.
The extracted features are designed for use in machine learning–based network analysis and anomaly detection.

## Project Scope
- PCAP to feature extraction pipeline
- Packet-level feature representation
- Flow-level aggregation using 5-tuple
- Statistical flow features for ML readiness

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Scapy
- Pandas, NumPy
